# NIRWALS Simulator

The [Near-Infrared Washburn Astronomical Laboratories Spectrograph (NIRWALS)](https://astronomers.salt.ac.za/instruments/nir/) is an infrared integral field spectrograph for the [Southern African Large Telescope (SALT)](https://www.salt.ac.za/). It provides medium resolution spectroscopy at R = 2000-5000 over the wavelength range of 800 to 1700 nm.
